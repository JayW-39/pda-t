PDA-T aims to translate the game Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Arcade (2010) into other languages that aren't the original Japanese.

Currently, the project is aimed at English and focuses on translating:

- Song Titles, Lyrics and Producer Names
- UI Elements
- Sprite-Based Text and various Japanese language

The aim is not to provide a completely accurate translation, but make the game playable and understandable to a player who does not speak Japanese.
PDA-T won't translate PV-Based graphics such as stop signs and other similar objects.

If there are any issues with the graphics used in the patch, such as odd-looking text, font mismatch, clipping, etc. Please report it as an issue.
